## Amazon-Web-Services


Visited the Cloud Academy web site and study about the lab sessions under AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate module and did the hands on practicals using amazon web services by creating an account there.





######01.Create your first Amazon EC2 instance (Linux)

Amazon EC2 is the most famous AWS service and allows you to launch different types of cloud instances and pay for them with a pay-per-use approach. EC2 provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes. This allows you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change. Amazon EC2 allows you to build and configure your instances as you like, from your operating system to your applications.


######02.Create your first Amazon EC2 instance (Winodows)
 AWS provides several Microsoft Windows Server AMIs that enables you to run any compatible Windows-based solution. You can use Windows-based applications, websites, and web-services written in .NET, for data processing, media transcoding, and any other task requiring Windows software.
 
######03.Managing instance volume Using EBS
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides persistent block level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud.  Each Amazon EBS volume is automatically replicated within its Availability Zone to protect you from component failure. This provides high availability and durability. Amazon EBS volumes offer consistent, low-latency performance needed to run your workloads.
######04.Create your first Amazon S3 bucket
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), provides secure, durable, and highly-scalable object storage. Amazon S3 allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. You'll pay only for the storage you actually use with no minimum fee and no setup cost. It can be used alone, or together with other AWS services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), and Amazon Glacier. You can also use Amazon S3 with third-party storage repositories and gateways.
######05.Create an EBS-Backed (Linux AMI)
An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an EC2 instance. You can customize an EC2 instance and then save the configuration as a custom AMI for your private or public use. Every EC2 instance launched selecting the customized AMI will contain any software or file that you've previously added.
######06.Create your first Amazon RDS Database
Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. You can migrate existing applications and tools that utilize a relational database to the Amazon Web Services because Amazon RDS offers access to the capabilities of a MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and the PostgreSQL database engine. Amazon RDS provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while managing time-consuming database administration tasks. This efficiency frees you to focus on your applications and business.
